## Creating tables with date partitions

### Query webpage analytics for a sample of visitors in 2017

queries with regular tables

```sql
#standardSQL
SELECT DISTINCT
  fullVisitorId,
  date,
  city,
  pageTitle
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions_raw`
WHERE date = '20170708'
LIMIT 5
```

* query webpage analytics for a sample of visitors in 2018

```sql
#standardSQL
SELECT DISTINCT
  fullVisitorId,
  date,
  city,
  pageTitle
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions_raw`
WHERE date = '20180708'
LIMIT 5
```

* Create a new partitioned table based on date

```sql
#standardSQL
 CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ecommerce.partition_by_day
 PARTITION BY date_formatted
 OPTIONS(
   description="a table partitioned by date"
 ) AS
 SELECT DISTINCT
 PARSE_DATE("%Y%m%d", date) AS date_formatted,
 fullvisitorId
 FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions_raw`
```

ecommerce > partition_by_day > details

## View data processed with a partitioned table

* dealing with data on partitioned table 
```sql
#standardSQL
SELECT *
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.partition_by_day`
WHERE date_formatted = '2016-08-01'
```


## Creating an auto-expiring partitioned table

### Explore the available NOAA weather data tables

big query console > resources > add data > explore public datasets > GSOD NOAA >view dataset

in query editor 
```sql
#standardSQL
 SELECT
   DATE(CAST(year AS INT64), CAST(mo AS INT64), CAST(da AS INT64)) AS date,
   (SELECT ANY_VALUE(name) FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` AS stations
    WHERE stations.usaf = stn) AS station_name,  -- Stations may have multiple names
   prcp
 FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*` AS weather
 WHERE prcp < 99.9  -- Filter unknown values
   AND prcp > 0      -- Filter stations/days with no precipitation
   AND CAST(_TABLE_SUFFIX AS int64) >= 2018
 ORDER BY date DESC -- Where has it rained/snowed recently
 LIMIT 10
```

### Your turn: Create a Partitioned Table


Table name: ecommerce.days_with_rain
Use the date field as your PARTITION BY
For OPTIONS, specify partition_expiration_days = 60
Add the table description = "weather stations with precipitation, partitioned by day"

```sql
#standardSQL
 CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ecommerce.days_with_rain
 PARTITION BY date
 OPTIONS (
   partition_expiration_days=60,
   description="weather stations with precipitation, partitioned by day"
 ) AS
 SELECT
   DATE(CAST(year AS INT64), CAST(mo AS INT64), CAST(da AS INT64)) AS date,


   (SELECT ANY_VALUE(name) FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` AS stations
    WHERE stations.usaf = stn) AS station_name,  -- Stations may have multiple names


   prcp
 FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*` AS weather
 WHERE prcp < 99.9  -- Filter unknown values
   AND prcp > 0      -- Filter
   AND CAST(_TABLE_SUFFIX AS int64) >= 2018
```


* tracks the average rainfall for the NOAA weather station in Wakayama, Japan which has significant precipitation

```sql
#standardSQL
# avg monthly precipitation
SELECT
  AVG(prcp) AS average,
  station_name,
  date,
  CURRENT_DATE() AS today,
  DATE_DIFF(CURRENT_DATE(), date, DAY) AS partition_age,
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) AS month
FROM ecommerce.days_with_rain
WHERE station_name = 'WAKAYAMA' #Japan
GROUP BY station_name, date, today, month, partition_age
ORDER BY date DESC; 
```

### Confirm the oldest partition_age is at or below 60 days

Update the ORDER BY clause to show the oldest partitions first

```sql
#standardSQL
# avg monthly precipitation

SELECT
  AVG(prcp) AS average,
  station_name,
  date,
  CURRENT_DATE() AS today,
  DATE_DIFF(CURRENT_DATE(), date, DAY) AS partition_age,
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) AS month
FROM ecommerce.days_with_rain
WHERE station_name = 'WAKAYAMA' #Japan
GROUP BY station_name, date, today, month, partition_age
ORDER BY partition_age DESC
```
